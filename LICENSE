RSA license update from February 19, 2000:

        The purpose of this memo is to clarify the status of intellectual
property rights asserted by RSA Security Inc. ("RSA") in the MD2, MD4 and
MD5 message-digest algorithms, which are documented in RFC-1319, RFC-1320,
and RFC-1321 respectively.

        Implementations of these message-digest algorithms, including
implementations derived from the reference C code in RFC-1319, RFC-1320, and
RFC-1321, may be made, used, and sold without license from RSA for any
purpose.

        No rights other than the ones explicitly set forth above are
granted.  Further, although RSA grants rights to implement certain
algorithms as defined by identified RFCs, including implementations derived
from the reference C code in those RFCs, no right to use, copy, sell, or
distribute any other implementations of the MD2, MD4, or MD5 message-digest
algorithms created, implemented, or distributed by RSA is hereby granted by
implication, estoppel, or otherwise.  Parties interested in licensing
security components and toolkits written by RSA should contact the company
to discuss receiving a license.  All other questions should be directed to
Margaret K. Seif, General Counsel, RSA Security Inc., 36 Crosby Drive,
Bedford, Massachusetts 01730.

        Implementations of the MD2, MD4, or MD5 algorithms may be subject to
United States laws and regulations controlling the export of technical data,
computer software, laboratory prototypes and other commodities (including
the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, and the Export Administration Act
of 1970).  The transfer of certain technical data and commodities may
require a license from the cognizant agency of the United States Government.
RSA neither represents that a license shall not be required for a particular
implementation nor that, if required, one shall be issued.


        DISCLAIMER: RSA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS AND EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, VALIDITY OF
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ISSUED OR PENDING, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR
OTHER DEFECTS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE MD2, MD4,
OR MD5 ALGORITHMS.  NOTHING IN THIS GRANT OF RIGHTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY GIVEN BY RSA THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
ALGORITHM WILL NOT INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD
PARTY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL RSA, ITS TRUSTEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
PARENTS AND AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY KIND RESULTING FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ALGORITHM, INCLUDING ECONOMIC
DAMAGE OR INJURY TO PROPERTY AND LOST PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER RSA
SHALL BE ADVISED, SHALL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT SHALL KNOW OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH INJURY OR DAMAGE.
